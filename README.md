A simple database connection is established using Java with MySQL. The main purpose of this project is to create a GUI interface with Java Swing, allowing users to add, edit, or delete rows in the database using buttons in the interface. Additionally, the project includes various filtering options. This is a simple project I developed for a university course.
(You can use the project yourself by entering your own MySQL username and password in the connection settings.)
